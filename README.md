I designed and developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to provide real-time insights into our sales operations. This initiative empowered data-driven decision-making, enabling the company to adapt and thrive in a dynamic market. My contributions to data modelling, visualization, and report generation resulted in enhanced sales strategies, increased efficiency, and improved business performance. This project not only showcased my analytical skills but also demonstrated my ability to drive tangible business outcomes through data-driven solutions.
